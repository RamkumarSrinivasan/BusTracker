MTA provides a zip file with shapefiles for the routes of all of their buses.  
There's also many zip files with schedule data in a funky fixed-width format.

1. There is inconsistent filename case in the route 1zip files.  You'll
want to convert everything to lowercase with:

$ rename 'tr/A-Z/a-z/'

2. The data is in a weird projection.  Import it as that projection:

$ shp2pgsql -s 2263 -d  nyc\ bus\ routes\ \(2004-09\)-lk-060427 mta_bus_routes|psql [database_name]

3. Now, convert the data to 4326:

alter table mta_bus_routes drop constraint enforce_srid_the_geom;
update mta_bus_routes set the_geom = st_transform(the_geom,4326);
alter table mta_bus_routes add constraint enforce_srid_the_geom check (srid(the_geom) = 4326);

4. Extract the schedule data (in-place)

./manage.py mta_extract [dir containing schedule zip files -- probably surface-bus]

5. Import the schedule and route data

./maange.py mta_import [dir containing schedule data] [table name for shape data: mta_bus_routes]
