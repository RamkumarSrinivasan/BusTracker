S98 has no westbound route in shapefile. 

bx14 has mixed-up directions (n/s vs e/w) -- FIXED

Q48: What does the direction "L" mean?  q48 appears to not be a big loop...

M14: Some go along ave A, some ave D -- but there are 5 routes in the
schedule data (all with wrong headsigns?) and 6 in the map.  6 is the
correct number according to the printed schedule -- A or D, west or
east, A with or without stop at w village/abington sq.  Also, route 
data has 4 westbound vs 2 eastbound routes, but schedule is 3/3(?)


m22, b49, m21, b8, b70 have no directions?
