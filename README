Edit settings.py to point to a database which has been set up for
postgis. 

If you are doing development or testing locally, you should set
LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT = True in setting.py. You should also set MEDIA_ROOT =
'/path/to/BusTracker/tracker/static/' so that the static files (e.g.,
JavaScript) will be served correctly. (For production servers,
LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT should be False and your webserver should be configured to
serve the files in BusTracker/tracker/static under
YOUR_DOMAIN.COM/tracker/static.)

[table_name] is the name of a table to hold Tiger data.  Download the 
2007 Tiger data from:
http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/county-files?county=36061

You need the 2007 data because GIDs have changed between 2007 and
later years, and bus routes may depend on certain GIDs


$ shp2pgsql fe_2007_36061_edges.shp -s 4326 [table_name]|psql -d [database_name]

$ ./manage.py syncdb
$ ./manage.py tiger_import [table_name] 
$ ./manage.py create_bus_route tracker/nyc_bus_routes.txt

You may now drop [table_name], if you like.
